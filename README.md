# Marks Management System

    Develop a Student Marks Management System using Git

## Requirements

- In this system, a central database stores students' marks for different subjects in a tabular format.
- Subject teachers can update marks as needed before the final submission.
- Teachers can view student names and roll numbers but only edit the marks for their
subject.
- When all teachers have completed their updates, the database is sorted by total marks and
made available for students to view
